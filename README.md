# Technical Challenge: Marketplace Analysis and Optimization System

## Problem Context

Design and implement a system that analyzes products in online marketplaces, identifies success patterns, and provides automated recommendations to optimize product listings. The system must be **scalable**, **secure**, and **maintainable**.

## Main Objectives

1. **Distributed Architecture**: Design a distributed architecture for product data ingestion and analysis.
2. **Recommendation System**: Implement a recommendation system based on identified patterns.
3. **Secure APIs**: Develop secure APIs with management for different access levels.
4. **Web Interface**: Create a web interface for visualizing and managing information.

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture and Scalability

- Design a **resilient data ingestion system**.
- Consider strategies for both **batch** and **real-time processing**.
- Include mechanisms for **failure handling** and **automatic retries**.
- Ensure **data consistency** and optimize overall system performance.

### Analysis System

- Develop **advanced text processing** to identify patterns in products.
- Establish a **scoring system** to evaluate relevant features.
- Generate **automated recommendations** based on data.
- Continuously **maintain and update metrics**.

### API and Security

- Implement a **robust authentication and authorization system**.
- Manage **roles and permissions** for differentiated access.
- Include **protection measures** (e.g., rate limiting) to maintain system integrity.
- Provide **endpoints** for data querying and management.
- Incorporate **monitoring and observability** mechanisms for performance and security tracking.

### Frontend

- Develop an **intuitive dashboard** for visualizing analyses and metrics.
- Create an **operational management interface**.
- Implement an **alert system** for incident response.
- Ensure a **responsive user experience** adapted for various devices.

## Deliverables

### Code and Architecture

- **Structured and well-documented repository**.
- **Infrastructure configuration**.
- **Automated tests** validating functionality and quality.
- **Integrated Continuous Deployment (CD) process**.
- **Detailed API documentation**.

### Technical Documentation

- **Architecture diagram** of the proposed system.
- **Description of technical decisions** and evaluated trade-offs.
- **Deployment guide** for the system.
- **Scalability strategy** and monitoring plan.
- **Guidelines** for incident management and resolution.

## Evaluation Criteria

### Architecture

- **Scalability** and **fault-handling capability**.
- Implementation of **security** and **observability** measures.

### Code Quality

- **Organization** and **quality of code**, following best practices and design patterns.
- **Coverage** and **robustness** of automated tests.
- **Efficiency** in error handling.

### Operations

- **Deployment** and **monitoring strategy**.
- **Quality of logs** and ease of debugging.
- **Maintainability** and long-term evolution of the system.
